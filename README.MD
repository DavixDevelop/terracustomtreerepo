## TerraPlusPlus: Custom Tree Repo Add-on

### What is it?
Custom Tree Repo Add-on is a mod that removes the default tree populator in TerraPlusPlus and replaces it with a custom tree populator that incorporates the [Custom Tree Repository](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/native-trees-of-europe-template-repository-1779952/)

### Features
As mentioned before, this mod incorporates the Custom Tree Repository provided by @lentebriesje, as well as the vanilla Minecraft trees. It accomplishes this by mixing both types of trees based on the Minecraft biome and the KÃ¶ppen-Geiger climate classification.
Next up, the distance between trees is offset following up with the trees either being offset or removed to make space for various structures like roads, paths, and building outlines.
The mod also takes into account the canopy value provided by TreeCover2000 and bases the tree height depending on the value, as by default TerraPlusPlus only uses the mentioned canopy value to know where to place a random Minecraft vanilla tree.
> As of right now the "mixing" is done based on fixed values, which will change in the future

### Future plans
As mentioned before tree mixing/offsets/heights is done as of right now based on fixed values. In a future release, this will be done dynamically, based on the Copernicus Global Dynamic Land Cover (ex. open/closed forest, type of forest...) and WWF biome.

A future release will also incorporate more custom trees, to represent a wider range of tree types and heights, because of the lack of custom trees for Asia and Australia.
